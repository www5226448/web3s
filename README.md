# web3s
This is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum supporting asynchronous requests.

If you want to synchronize a method, you can use the sync method in utils to change the asynchronous method to synchronous.

You can use pip to install:
```shell
$ pip install web3s
```

All APIs are consistent with the web3py 4.8.0 version.
This package only suppoorts the web3 http provider.

Please note that some provider may doesn't support the txpool api.
